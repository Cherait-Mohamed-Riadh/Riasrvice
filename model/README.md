# 3D Model Directory

## Required File
Please place your `personal_computer.glb` file in this directory.

## Model Requirements
- File format: .glb (preferred) or .gltf
- Recommended size: Under 10MB for web performance
- Recommended polygon count: Under 50,000 triangles

## Model Positioning
The model will be automatically:
- Scaled to 0.8x
- Positioned at center
- Rotatable with mouse interaction
- Auto-rotating when idle

## Supported Formats
- GLB (recommended)
- GLTF with textures

## Performance Tips
- Use compressed textures
- Optimize mesh geometry
- Consider using Draco compression for smaller file sizes
